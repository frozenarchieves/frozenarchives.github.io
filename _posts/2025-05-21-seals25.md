This June, Iâ€™m heading out on a 33-day research cruise across the Northwest Atlantic for **SEALS 2025** (*Sediment Exchange Along Labrador Sea*). Our team will explore **neodymium (Nd)** and **iron (Fe)** fluxes between seafloor sediments and the water column â€” work that could help unlock how ocean circulation evolved over time.

We'll be working 24/7 aboard a research vessel, using **multicorers**, **gravity corers**, **CTD rosettes**, and **McLane pumps** to collect sediments and bottom water. Our goal is to quantify metal fluxes and isotope signals that can improve how we interpret past ocean circulation.

Hereâ€™s a glimpse into our setup and science gear:

Hereâ€™s to a successful cruise â€” from **Woods Hole, MA** to **Reykjavik, Iceland** â€” exploring how sediments and seawater communicate across one of Earthâ€™s key ocean gateways.
