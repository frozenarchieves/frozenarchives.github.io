👋 Hey there! I'm a PhD candidate studying the dynamics of the Antarctic Ice Sheet over the past 1.4 million years using Ice-Rafted Debris (IRD) from deep-sea sediment cores. I use machine learning, geochemistry, iceberg trajectory modelling to understand past Antarctic ice-sheet behavior and how it connects with climate variability.

I'm particularly interested in:

Using AI/ML (like YOLO) to identify IRD in X-ray images of sediment cores
Exploring how IRD flux changes relate to the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT)
Reconstructing iceberg trajectories to better understand ocean circulation patterns
Applying isotopic fingerprinting (Sr, Nd, Pb) for provenance analysis
You can find me coding in Python (mostly in Jupyter Lab), working with deep-sea sediment cores, or building visualizations of the Southern Ocean using datasets like BedMachine Antarctica.

Outside the lab, I'm always down for food adventures and the occasional dive into a good brewery.
